Design of Subsonic Turbine's and Compressor's Blades

The module provides an introduction about the axial turbine and axial compressor blades design. For the turbine blade, a Bezier function is utilized for a camberline construction, while in the compressor blade, the author uses the NACA Camberline equation. A given set of data of the base profile is used to plot the suction and pressure lines. The MATLAB code link for plotting those blades is presented above.
